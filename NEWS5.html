<p>By:  Alto, Khaila Marionne M.</p> <br>
    <p>As a way to help students from Grades 7 and 11 transition, Muntinlupa Science High School (MSHS) held an orientation at the school gymnasium on June 10, 2025, highlighting the new academic environment.
<br><br>
The orientation was separated into two segments, starting with the Grade 7 students then proceeding to the Grade 11 students. JHS Guidance Counselor Ms. Lindsay Maranan briefed the Grade 7 students about the school's rules and regulations, while Grade 11 students were informed by the School Principal Dr. Ador B. Querubin.
<br><br>
A Grade 11 student remarked, "It made me appreciate how privileged we are today," talking about the importance of learning and education.
<br><br>
Dr. Ador B. Querubin announced new rules to be implemented within school premises, prioritizing the safety and security of MSHS students.
<br><br>
Both orientations concluded with the students proceeding to their respective classrooms, conducting their own clean-up drives.
While the reform has been generally welcomed, some education stakeholders have raised concerns regarding the reduced number of core subjects and the need for additional teacher training and resources to support the transition.
