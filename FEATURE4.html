<p>By: Umali, Sean Alexander P.</p> <br>
    <p>Sir Ador's leadership continues to make a meaningful impact, now reaching the halls of Muntinlupa Science High School (MunSci). Known for his thoughtful and action-oriented leadership style back at Tunasan National High School (TNHS), he brings with him the same sense of purpose and student-centered decision-making that once reshaped an entire campus.
<br><br>
At TNHS, Sir Ador oversaw the transition of MNHS Tunasan Annex into its own independent school, a move that empowered its identity and opened new opportunities for both students and staff. He also paid attention to everyday student needs: when the small canteen became overcrowded, he relocated it to a long, open area at the back of the school, improving traffic flow and comfort during breaks. To make student gatherings more functional and weather-proof, he installed a large white tent over the open court, allowing events and assemblies to happen rain or shine.
<br><br>
Now at MunSci, Sir Ador is applying the same practical mindset to meet the school’s unique needs. Under his leadership, cleanliness across the campus has noticeably improved, setting a more organized and focused learning environment.
<br><br>
The school's entrances have also been renovated not only for aesthetics but to support a major change: tricycles and vehicles are now allowed to enter the campus to safely drop off students, minimizing the risks faced during morning rush. These are changes that may seem simple, but they reflect a deeper understanding of student experience and everyday safety.
<br><br>
Sir Ador doesn’t lead with fanfare or dramatic overhauls instead, he listens, observes, and acts. From TNHS to MunSci, his leadership remains rooted in the belief that meaningful change often begins with the small, overlooked things. And with every step, he proves that leadership is not just about authority, but about awareness, empathy, and the courage to improve what needs fixing. MunSci may be a new setting, but Sir Ador’s impact feels just as familiar and just as strong.
