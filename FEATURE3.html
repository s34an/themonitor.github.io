<p>By:Fuentes, Loterios Maximus P.</p> <br>
    <p>Learning is important because it openes the mind, helps us grow, guides us through lifeâ€™s challenges, and gives us the knowledge and understanding we need to make better choices and become better people, making a better environment.
<br><br>
Through learning, students become more enhanced in academics and character, preparing them for real-world problems and make smart and logical choices in life that can significantly help them in their careers and works by shaping them into responsible individuals.
<br><br>
Learning helps student discover more than they could ever think of, gives them a chance to explore their interests, improve their talents and hobbies, and uncover the things in life that they would cling unto because of the memories that they have made.
<br><br>
Everyone makes mistakes, and through mistakes is how you can learn by building a strong foundation that helps people by giving them an understanding of the possible outcomes and consequences that they could face.
