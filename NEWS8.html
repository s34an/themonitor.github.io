<p>By:  Pua, Chieny S.</p> <br>
    <p>As a way to close off Pride month, the Student Gender and Development Council (SGDC) of Muntinlupa Science High School hosted a celebration themed "Aurora: The Dawn of Pride" on June 28, 2025.<br><br>
To start the event, a fun run was organized at the Muntinlupa Track and Field Oval, which was open to everyone. According to some students who participated, the fun run helped them relax, especially after the stress-filled weeks prior.<br><br>
Simultaneously, school clubs opened their booths to offer a wide range of items—from snacks and drinks to bracelets, photo booths, water guns, handcuffs, and marriage booths.<br><br>
As part of the event, alumnus Benedict John Caperocho spoke on LGBTQIA+ rights, emphasizing the SOGIE Bill’s role in protecting against discrimination. He also highlighted the need for legal recognition of same-sex marriage and divorce to ensure equality and dignity.<br><br>
Later on, the assembly and introduction for the “Aurora: The Dawn of Pride” Concert began, followed by performances from several bands such as Point Horizon, No Label, Traffic Jam, Stereoxide, Boundary, and a dance performance by Amouroze.<br><br>
There was also a special number from drag queens Satyre and Bamvolbae, who both delivered lip sync performances of "Power" by Little Mix and "Pink Pony Club" by Chappell Roan.<br><br>
Unfortunately, the event was cut short due to an emergency, prompting the audience to say their goodbyes earlier than expected.
