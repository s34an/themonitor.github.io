<p>By: Suba, Julien Alyson</p> <br>
    <p>To report school updates, present accomplishments, and facilitate classroom-level officer elections, Muntinlupa Science High School (MSHS) held its first Homeroom Parent-Teacher Association (HRPTA) meeting for School Year 2025-2026 on June 28 at the school gymnasium.<br><br>
Hosted by Engr. Calrk Jhune “CJ” Marmeto and Ms. Claire Martinez, the program opened with the national anthem and a prayer, followed by welcome remarks from Mr. Paolo Bundoc.<br><br>
Ms. Mary Jane Amion delivered the Accomplishment Report, which featured a video presentation highlighting ₱1.7 million in donations gathered through Brigada Eskwela and other initiatives.<br><br>
“We will bring back the glory for Muntinlupa Science High School,” Dr. Querubin declared, determined to improve the school and provide a better learning environment for the MunSci community.<br><br>
He reported that MSHS enrolled 1,341 junior high school students and 746 senior high school students for the academic year. Originally, only 360 Grade 7 students were to be accepted out of the 600 who took the entrance exam, but the two additional sections were opened to accommodate more students.<br><br>
Public Schools District Supervisors Dr. Evangeline Aman and Dr. Eric Fungo delivered inspirational messages, mentioning the A-D-O-R acronym which stands for Aspire, Dream, Overcome, and Rise to encourage parents and students to engage.<br><br>
Closing remarks were delivered by Ms. Zarina Pabelonia, showing gratitude to the stakeholders that contributed to the improvement of MSHS during Brigada Eskwela 2025.<br><br>
After the program, parents proceeded to their respective classrooms for the classroom-level HRPTA officer elections and discussed plans and concerns regarding room renovations which were overseen by class advisers.
