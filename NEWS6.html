<p>By:  Gonzaludo, Gabriel S.</p> <br>
    <p>To promote digital literacy, online safety, and the responsible use of technology, the City Government of Muntinlupa hosted a seminar for digital citizenship in line with the celebration of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Month, with the theme “Walang Iwanan sa Digital Bayanihan,” on June 30 at the Museo ng Muntinlupa Floor Theater.<br><br>
The seminar was organized by the Muntinlupa LGU through its Management Information System Office (MIS), in partnership with the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), to emphasize the importance of ICT in nation-building and responsible digital engagement. It was hosted by Mr. Albert Sembrero and opened with remarks from ICT Committee Chairperson Coun. Rodolfo “Dado” Moldez, followed by a video message from DICT Secretary Henry Aguda.<br><br>
Officer-in-Charge (OIC), Office of the Schools Division Superintendent (SDS) Dr. Violeta Gonzales served as the keynote speaker, drawing a parallel between life in the sea and the digital world. Muntinlupa Mayor Ruffy Biazon then delivered an inspirational message “Always remember, relate with other humans as a human,” pointing out that digital citizenship requires respect, empathy, and kindness in all virtual interactions.<br><br>
The program was divided into two topics which are “Social Media and Local Governance” tackled by Acting Head of Public Information Office (PIO) Ms. Noemi M. Gonzales, featured the different programs offered by the PIO of Muntinlupa, followed by Prof. Ernesto “Boogie” Baydon who discussed “Digital Citizenship.” He mentioned that “Every click, post and share leaves a footprint,” urging participants to be more mindful of their actions in the digital world, as each carries consequences.<br><br>
Marking the end of the seminar, Acting Head Management Information Systems Office Ms. Nancy B. Torero ended with the statement “Be kind, be safe online and be smart,” which was followed by a photo opportunity with the participating schools and guest speakers.
