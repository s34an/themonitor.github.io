<p>By: Gonzaludo, Gabriel S.</p> <br>
To officially mark the opening of School Year 2025 to 2026, Muntinlupa Science High School (MSHS) held its annual Brigada Eskwela in line with the Department of Education's nationwide campaign theme "Sama-sama para sa Bayang Bumabasa" from June 9 to 15.
<br><br>
The event began with a motorcade around Tunasan and a community Zumba session, followed by a week-Song campus clean-up drive, "MunSci Bayanihan, led by teachers and student volunteers from various organizations.
<br><br>
Incoming Grade 7 and 11 students attended orientation sessions, while the rest of the junior and senior high school students joined in cleaning and organizing their assigned classrooms.
<br><br>
On June 11, MSHS inaugurated the newly constructed JRF Building for Grade 3 students and faculty with a ribbon-cutting and blessing ceremony.
<br><br>
Grade 12 students took an UPCAT mock exam to help them prepare for the University of the Philippines College Admission Test.
<br><br>
The week concluded with a dry run for all grade levels, during which subject equirements were distributed to each section. 
<br><br>
A closing program marked the official end of Brigada Eskwela 2025, recognizing the efforts of the school community.
<br><br>
As per DEPED, this year's Brigada Eskwela calls on communities to support reading and literacy efforts, in line with the 'Bagong Pilipinas' agenda for inclusive and quality education.
