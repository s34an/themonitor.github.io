<p>By: Sto. Tomas, Shawn M.</p> <br>
    <p>The Brigada Eskwela happens every school opening and it is one of the most awaited events in the school. It’s more than just cleaning, it’s a true display of bayanihan, where teachers, students, parents, and volunteers work together to make the school clean, safe, and tidy for everyone to be comfortable. It’s Brigada Eskwela a week where everyone comes together to prepare and clean the environment of our  school
<br><br>
This school year’s kickoff was extra meaningful. With the support of the government, leaders, and volunteers from all walks of life, classrooms were cleaned, gardens trimmed, chairs and tables were cleaned, and walls repainted.
<br><br>
But Brigada Eskwela is more than cleaning, it’s a community spirit in motion. It shows how much people care to our environment so that we can keep the environment clean, not just about the building, but about the students who will soon who will use it.
<br><br>
Of course, there are challenges. Some people feel pressure to donate. Others worry that too much is asked from teachers. But when all the work is done with heart, not obligation, the results speak for themselves.
<br><br>
In the end, Brigada Eskwela reminds us that education is not just the job of schools, it’s a shared responsibility, and to how we can keep our environment clean and safe. And at Munsci, that responsibility is carried with pride.
