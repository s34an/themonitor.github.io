    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">New SHS curriculum begins pilot implementation in Munti</h3>
<p>By: Flores, Kryz Dhaniel P.</p> <br>
    <p>The Department of Education (DepEd) has begun the pilot implementation of the newly strengthened Senior High School (SHS) curriculum in selected schools in Muntinlupa City, National Capital Region (NCR), starting School Year 2025–2026.
<br><br>
This initiative is part of a nationwide curriculum reform aimed at enhancing students’ core competencies, improving alignment with industry demands, and reducing academic overload.
<br><br>
Under the revised SHS curriculum, the number of core subjects has been reduced to five, which will be taken throughout Grade 11. These include Effective Communication, Life and Career Skills, General Mathematics, General Science, and Pag-aaral ng Kasaysayan at Lipunang Pilipino. This streamlined core replaces the previous 15-subject structure, allowing students to focus on essential competencies.
<br><br>
In addition, students will now be able to select electives from various clusters such as Arts, STEM, Business, ICT, Maritime, and Technical-Vocational (TechPro), regardless of their main track. The work immersion requirement has also been significantly expanded from 80 hours to between 320 to 640 hours, depending on the student's chosen field.
<br><br>
In Muntinlupa, four schools have been selected to pilot the strengthened SHS curriculum. These are Muntinlupa National High School, Sucat Senior High School, Far Eastern University   Alabang Senior High, and Christ the King School of Muntinlupa. Other public schools in the city, including Lakeview Integrated School, Tunasan National High School, and Cupang Senior High School, will continue to follow the existing K to 12 SHS curriculum during the transition period.
<br><br>
The pilot implementation is part of a broader national rollout involving 889 schools across the country. According to DepEd, the full implementation of the revised curriculum is scheduled for School Year 2026–2027, following the evaluation of the pilot phase.
<br><br>
While the reform has been generally welcomed, some education stakeholders have raised concerns regarding the reduced number of core subjects and the need for additional teacher training and resources to support the transition.
